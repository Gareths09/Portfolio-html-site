                    <p>I started off playing rugby at the age of 7 for my local town Horsham and played 
                        for them till I was 18 where I was captaining the Colts team which was for players 
                        aged between 17 and 18.  After Horsham I played for the University of Portsmouth 
                        for a couple of years then the Dallas Harlequins while I was in Dallas and then a 
                        couple of years with the Seattle rugby team.</p>
                    <p>After playing for so many years my body was starting the feel aches and pains of playing 
                        for so long I stopped playing after a couple of years in Seattle.</p>
                    <p>When I stopped playing rugby is when I started snowboarding as I needed a new winter hobby, 
                        the mountains were on my door step in Seattle so found myself up there most weekends in the Winter.  
                        I would also make regular trips around the pacific northwest to explore other mountains.</p>
                    <p>At this time I also started training Olympic Weightlifting which is moving a heavy barbell from 
                        the ground to over head in 2 different lifts, the snatch and clean and jerk. After training for 
                        many years I became rather competitive in local competitions around Washington state. Sadly when I moved 
                        back to the UK in January 2017 I injured my lower back and its been a long slow recovery but at the start of 2020 
                        I have started light exercise again looking forward to getting back in shape.</p>
                    <p>I've always been a fan of anything automotive and motorsport and regally attending motorsport events 
                        across the UK. I'm a member of the Goodwood Road Racing Club which among other things allows me to do 
                        track days at the historic Goodwood motor racing circuit in my own vehicle. Over the summer I am a mechanic for 
                        my brother and his friends who own America race cars known as NASCAR. They get invited to events all over the UK 
                        such as American Speed Fest at Brands Hatch, Goodwood Members Meeting, Chris Evans charity event Carfest and many 
                        more to demo the cars and I go with them and help keep the cars running.</p>
