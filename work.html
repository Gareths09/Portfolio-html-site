                    <p>Employed as 2nd line support engineer I am part of a 4 man team dealing with calls escalated from

                        having problems with either the Trend software or hardware.  With my background in software 
                        support I was brought onto the team to primarily focus on supporting the new supervisor software

                        an SQL Server 2012 back end. Any issue I was unable to resolve were either escalated to 3rd line support 
                        team or logged as a bug in the Jira system.</p>
